+# Building-a-Homelab
+
+## Overview
+This repo documents my homelab journey: what I built, why I built it, what it runs, and how I keep it documented. It is a living record of decisions, changes, and the current state of the lab.
+
+## Goals & Scope
+- Capture the “why” behind architecture and tooling choices.
+- Track what’s deployed, how it’s configured, and how it’s maintained.
+- Provide a repeatable reference for rebuilds, migrations, and recovery.
+
+## Current State
+- **Status:** Actively building and documenting.
+- **Last updated:** Ongoing; see the changelog in `docs/changelog.md`.
+
+## Hardware Inventory
+- **Servers:** (add model/specs)
+- **Storage:** (add disks/arrays)
+- **Networking:** (add switches/APs)
+- **Power & racks:** (add UPS/rack details)
+
+## Network Topology
+See `docs/network.md` for a living description of VLANs, addressing, and routing decisions.
+
+## Services & Why
+See `docs/services.md` for a list of services, their purpose, and the rationale behind each choice.
+
+## Build Log / Timeline
+Key milestones and changes are tracked in `docs/changelog.md`.
+
+## Documentation Rationale
+Good documentation is the backbone of a stable homelab. It helps with:
+- **Repeatability:** Rebuild or migrate without guesswork.
+- **Resilience:** Faster recovery during outages or failures.
+- **Clarity:** Remembering why certain decisions were made.
+- **Sharing:** Helping others understand and learn from the setup.
+
+## How to Read This Repo
+- Start with this README for the high-level view.
+- Dive into `docs/` for details on services, network, and changes.
+
+## Status & Roadmap
+**Completed**
+- Repo initialized
+
+**In Progress**
+- Documenting baseline hardware and network layout
+
+**Planned**
+- Add service inventory with reasons and runbooks
+- Add backups and monitoring strategy
